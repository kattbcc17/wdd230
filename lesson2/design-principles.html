                Netflix uses a great method of arranging graphic elements by order of importance.
                By relying on principles relating to size, color, contrast, white and more,
                you can influence how users interact and they can purchase their services.
            </p>
            <p>
                Visual hierarchy affects what you look at and focus on in a design,
                whether it's an image, graphic design, or web design. It's a key player
                in ct (i.e., how information is organized and displayed for easy understanding and navigation)
                and can greatly impact the user experience (UX).

                The design element of proximity was applied by grouping all the connected elements to each other.
                The logo, together with the menu are grouped, the business and product information are all in the bottom of the page, 
                and the image showcasing one of the products is in the middle.

                The color scheme for the company, Razer, is simple and dark. Important elements are highlighted by using brighter colors.
                The logo has a bright green color and the product has a hint of bright colors that are really eye-catching.
            </p>
            <p>The interface is adorned with high-contrast colors, especially with the text, images with alternative text, ARIA markers, and elements utilizing the appropriate labels. While the website also implements subtly animated and transitional effects, theyâ€™re not overused or overwhelming.</p>
